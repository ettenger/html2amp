Whether you&#x2019;re on a rocky rural road in the desert, in a deep blizzard high atop the Continental Divide, walking up to the elementary school on a Friday afternoon to retrieve your son, or sitting with your feet in the sand on the Windward shores of Oahu, those fuckin&#x2019; cars are right there with you &#x2013; roaring, stinking, crashing, and impoverishing their owners.</p>\n<p>All this would be excusable if all these cars were providing an essential service. If every car trip delivered great rewards to its driver, and by extension to society as a whole, I&#x2019;d gladly toss down this keyboard and stand up so I could cheer on the heroic drivers as they passed by. Just as I solemnly accept that digging up a 27 kilometre tunnel of solid rock beneath Switzerland to build the Large Hadron Collider was a worthwhile wound to inflict on our planet because of the expected advancements to science, I could accept that paving over most of our cities to accommodate cars is Good.</p>\n<p>But unfortunately, that&#x2019;s not the case. After years of careful study, observations, and interviews with real car drivers, I have come to the conclusion that about 90% of the car use that occurs in the United States is Pure Bullshit. But don&#x2019;t get out your boxing gloves and start knocking out motorists just yet, because the ridiculousness is baked right into our culture. Our people are victims rather than perpetrators, even if their suffering is rather comical and clown-like.</p>\n<p>Luckily, today I&#x2019;ll present a cure for the problem.</p>\n<p>My home town of Longmont, Colorado represents the ultimate laboratory for studying Car Clown disease, as it is sufficiently small and bike-friendly that car trips within town are completely unnecessary. Since groceries and kids are <a href=\"https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/10/20/mmm-challenge-try-getting-your-groceries-with-a-bike-trailer/\"><span>easily handled by a bike trailer</span></a>, the only reason to drive would be physical impairment, transporting items too large for a trailer, or driving to another city.</p>\n<p>Yet these intra-city trips are commonplace. When I see a car ease into a parking spot, I always run to assist the driver with getting out into their wheelchair, but I am stunned to find that <em>they usually have working legs after all</em>! People drive to the school to pick up and drop off kids. To the grocery store. To the restaurants. To the gym. To each other&#x2019;s houses. Back and forth on Main Street to show off. Every road sees plenty of cars and personal trucks, some of them in dangerous numbers. And inside, every vehicle is equipped with a La-Z-boy recliner, upon which a tragic clown sits, pushing the soft-touch pedals, turning the power-assisted wheel, and talking on some sort of Clownophone.</p>\n<p>The clowns have to wait in line when the traffic light turns red. They have to bumble though the parking lots and wait for each other to back out of parking spaces, because their machines are so bulky that two cannot pass each other in a space less than 20 feet wide. They line up at special events and fight for places to park on the streets. Then they line up at the gas station and the car wash and the oil change shop. And the machines make them fatter and poorer every time they use them.</p>\n<p>And we haven&#x2019;t even addressed the most clown-like invention of them all:&#xA0;<strong>the drive-through</strong> (or &#x2018;drive-thru&#x2019; as it they spell it here, which is suitable because &#x201C;thru&#x201D; is not even a word, just as drive-through services should not exist). The clowns actually sit for several minutes in a self-imposed traffic jam, engines idling, just so somebody can&#xA0;<em>hand them some shit through the window of their car! </em></p>\n<p>Mustachians like you and I view an idling engine like a bleeding wound or an overflowing toilet. It&#x2019;s something to be alarmed at, and to correct immediately. But Car Clowns actually idle&#xA0;<em>deliberately</em>, sometimes to get something as ridiculous as&#xA0;<em>a cup of expensive coffee in a disposable paper cup.</em>&#xA0;When I see these lines of Drive-Thru Clowns, I find the urge to get off my bike and walk down the lineup systematically PUNCHING EACH DRIVER IN THE FACE through their open window to be almost overwhelming.</p>\n<p>It sounds like a terrible fate when I describe it like that, but yet for almost everyone in the country, this is reality. Most Car Clowns will acknowledge that their lives are pretty inconvenient, but then claim that a car is necessary to prevent the even greater inconveniences of public transit, walking, or not going anywhere at all.</p>\n<p>Well, here&#x2019;s the good news: Car Clown Disease is not an unavoidable thing. It&#x2019;s simply the product of bad habits. If you can reprogram the bad habits you&#x2019;ve built around cars, you can slide into the cool camp of Conscious Car Users instead. It&#x2019;s a land where traffic is sparse, the view out your window is breathtaking, and cost is negligible.</p>\n<p>To cure the disease, you just need to change the way you&#xA0;<em>feel</em> about driving. Right now, you probably feel that it&#x2019;s just something you do because it&#x2019;s necessary. Maybe you even find it pleasant at times (hell, I sure do). You have the cozy seats, the climate control, the stereo, lights, knobs and buttons, and all that power. You can go anywhere with that thing.</p>\n<p>But there&#x2019;s more to it than that. When you use a 3500-pound car to transport your 150-pound self around, 96 percent of the weight of that clump of matter is the car. You&#x2019;re moving 25 times more junk around than you need to, and thus using 25 times more energy to do it.</p>\n<p>Imagine that you&#x2019;re hungry for lunch, so you go to a restaurant. But you don&#x2019;t just order yourself a blackened salmon salad for $15.00. You order&#xA0;<em>twenty five salads for $375.00!&#xA0;</em>Then, you eat one of them, and leave the other 24 blackened salmon salads, $360.00 worth of food, to get collected by the waiter and slopped unceremoniously into a big black garbage bag. All that fine wild-caught Alaskan Salmon, lovingly seasoned and grilled. All the fine crumbles of feta cheese, the mango salsa, diced green onion, shaved peppers, rich zingy dressing, and everything else the chef worked on for hours &#x2013; plopped into the slimy garbage bag.&#xA0;<strong>This is exactly what you are doing, every time you drive!</strong></p>\n<p>And you&#x2019;re not just wasting your own money, of course. You are wasting the gasoline that the rest of the world works so hard to produce, puncturing seabeds and spilling stadium-loads of oil into pristine wilderness areas as a necessary byproduct. Destroying coral reefs and flooding coastlines with your carbon emissions. Clogging roads and creating demand for roadway expansion, indirectly raising your own taxes. It&#x2019;s a whole lot of badness we&#x2019;re doing, every time we drive. It&#x2019;s not just a matter of &#x201C;Hey, it&#x2019;ll only cost me ten bucks for the gas&#x201D;. It&#x2019;s a matter of choosing to be an asshole. I fully admit that I drive plenty of miles in cars too, and <span>I too am being an asshole every time I do it</span>. Other people think you&#x2019;re being an asshole when you drive too, and you should be just a little bit embarrassed every time you are seen driving. I sure am.</p>\n<p>The goal here is not to create negative stress in your life. Just acknowledge that whenever you turn the key, you need to say, <strong>&#x201C;Here we go. I&#x2019;m being an asshole again&#x201D;.&#xA0;</strong>It&#x2019;s a subtle change, but a powerful one once you embrace it. And of course, your assholism scales with the size and weight of the vehicle. If you&#x2019;re considering driving a pickup truck or large SUV for personal transport, the asshole factor should be so overwhelming that you feel like running inside to cower in a closet every time you even look out at your driveway. Feel the pain. Embrace it. Over time, work to reduce it.</p>\n<p>On top of that, every time you drive on a local trip that could be handled by bike, you are telling both the world and yourself, &#x201C;I am already so physically fit and healthy, that I could not possibly benefit from an extra few miles of biking&#x201D;. Occasionally this is true, like if you just returned from a mountain century ride and have raw butt cheeks, blistered hands, and absolutely no energy left to crank the pedals. In this situation, sure, go ahead and take the car out to get groceries. You deserve it. For the rest of us, what is your excuse?&#xA0;<strong>Unless you just rode 60 miles, you will probably benefit greatly by leaving the car at home.</strong></p>\n<p>So there you have it: 3 simple steps to automotive habit change. With every potential car trip, think of the 24 plates of wasted salmon. Ask yourself if it&#x2019;s worth being a deliberate asshole, and ask yourself if you have any possible use for a bit more health and physical fitness. Do it every time, so it becomes a habit.</p>\n<p>You may find your automobile travel being greatly reduced, which of course has massive financial benefits as well. And for those remaining trips that pass the Triple Anti-Car-Clown Gauntlet: well, those are probably some hella good car trips, so you will have such a good time that it will be worth the consequences.</p> <p><strong>Epilogue, 1 day later:&#xA0;</strong>As usual, this article has gathered its share of complaints from new readers. &#x201C;Waah, Waah, don&#x2019;t call me a clown&#x201D;, &#x201C;Biking is dangerous where I live&#x201D;, etc.</p>\n<p>Instead of continuing my usual bossy insensitive life coach routine, I&#x2019;ll take a rare moment to remind those people what I&#x2019;m really trying to accomplish with this article: It&#x2019;s not to make you feel bad or to try to make myself feel good. It is just to raise awareness about how there really is an alternative to a nothing-but-cars lifestyle&#xA0;<em>if you think about it when making future decisions.</em></p>\n<p>Sure, you might have trapped yourself into a car-dependent lifestyle for now. But remember, you created that trap yourself.&#xA0;If you get in the habit of lightheartedly calling yourself a clown every time you drive, and imagining those 24 plates of wasted food, you&#x2019;ll start thinking, &#x201C;hey, maybe there&#x2019;s another way&#x201D;.</p>\n<p>Then, you might try walking or biking (or hell, even taking the train) on a fair-weather basis. Just do it when it&#x2019;s easy.&#xA0;Then, it will get easier, which means that soon enough, it will be easy most of the time.</p>\n<p>Next time you move to a new house or a new job, suddenly the consideration of &#x201C;I&#x2019;d rather not be a car clown&#x201D; will be in your mind. You will make more balanced decisions. The reason I took the job in Boulder instead of Petaluma way back in 1999 was because I could afford a house within biking distance of work here, but I couldn&#x2019;t out there. Even if you live in the center of a NASCAR oval right now, and work 67 miles away, you don&#x2019;t have to do that forever. You, too, have a choice of where you live and work in the future. I&#x2019;m just planting a seed in your mind.</p>\n<p>Only once this seed grows into the fruit of independence, can you wean yourself from the Poisonous Teat of the Automobile.</p> </div>",
